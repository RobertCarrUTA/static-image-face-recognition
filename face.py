  Description:
    This program is designed for face recognition and annotation in images. 
    It loads images from a specified directory, detects faces, and matches 
    them against a known database of faces. The program allows for adding new 
    faces to the database and processes images in parallel to improve performance.
    Users can also quit the program at any time by typing 'q', 'quit', or 'stop' 
    in the terminal
